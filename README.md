# Perryhook
https://github.com/cattyngmd/cutehook <- Original. <br>
A Python made Discord webhook spammer usually used for token loggers to spam them/delete them original by cattyn I edited it so u can change the avatar to whatever u want instead of it being hardcoded & fixed the username not changing since discord has changed it to be "username" when sending the request instead of "name" changed the logo it prints out when running it & added a rate limiting system so u can now spam (theoretically) forever until they either delete the webhook or u do other then that all the other stuff by cattyn most based russian I have met open to any requests. <br>
