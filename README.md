  <summary>Changelog:</summary> <br>
  Avatar is now customizable instead of being hardcoded. <br>
  Fixed the username option not working. <br>
  Changed the logo it prints. <br>
  Reformatted a little. <br>
  Added a rate limiting system to spam (theoretically) forever until they either delete the webhook or u do. <br>
  Added a length checker to the username & message part so that incase u put it over the discord limit it will alert u or else it just wont send at all and u will be wasting ur time. <br>
  Made it Asynchronous to be a little faster. <br>
