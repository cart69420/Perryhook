# Perryhook
https://github.com/cattyngmd/cutehook <- Original. <br>
A Python made Discord webhook spammer usually used for token loggers to spam them/delete them original by cattyn I only made it so u can change the avatar to whatever u want instead of it being hardcoded & fixed the username not changing since discord has changed it to be "username" when sending the request instead of "name" changed the logo it prints out when running it cause in my terminal it was hard af to read and added a rate limiting system so u can now spam (theoretically) forever until they either delete the webhook or u do other then that all the other stuff by cattyn most based russian I have met open to any requests I can try to do although I don't code in Python why not give it a shot. <br>
